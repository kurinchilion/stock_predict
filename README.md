### Finance with Python Streamlit
<p>create a Streamlit app with Plotly to visualize Bollinger Bands for a given stock symbol using Yahoo Finance data.</p>

####  Environment setup
``` shell
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv venv
$ ./venv/Scripts/activate (for windows)
$ source venv/bin/activate (for mac)
```

###  Bollinger Band


Bollinger Bands are a type of technical analysis tool defined by a set of trendlines plotted two standard deviations (positively and negatively) away from a simple moving average (SMA) of a security's price. This method was developed by John Bollinger in the 1980s.

##### Components of Bollinger Bands:
<p><strong>Middle Band</strong>: This is the simple moving average (SMA) of the security's price, usually set to 20 periods.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Band</strong>: This is the SMA plus two standard deviations of the price.</p>
<p><strong>Lower Band</strong>: This is the SMA minus two standard deviations of the price.</p>

##### Interpretation:
<p><strong>Width of Bands</strong>: Indicates volatility. When the bands are wider, volatility is high; when they are narrower, volatility is low.</p>
<p><strong>Price Relationship</strong>: If the price moves towards the upper band, it may be overbought. If the price moves towards the lower band, it may be oversold.</p>


```shell
$ touch bollinger_bands.py
$ pip install streamlit plotly yfinance pandas
```

####  Bollinger Band Code Explanation

<p><strong>Data Retrieval</strong>: The get_stock_data function uses the yfinance library to download historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.</p>
<p>Bollinger Bands Calculation</strong>: The calculate_bollinger_bands function calculates the Simple Moving Average (SMA), the standard deviation, and the upper and lower Bollinger Bands.</p>
<p><strong>Plotting</strong>: The plot_bollinger_bands function uses Plotly to create an interactive plot of the closing prices along with the Bollinger Bands.</p>
<p><strong>Streamlit App</strong>: The main function sets up the Streamlit interface, takes user input for the stock symbol, fetches and processes the data, and displays the Bollinger Bands plot.</p>


#### Running the Bollinger Band app
```shell
$ streamlit run bollinger_bands.py
```

<p>This app provides a user-friendly way to visualize Bollinger Bands for any given stock symbol using real-time data from Yahoo Finance.</p>


###  Bollinger Band Prediction
```shell
$ touch bollinger_band_prediction.py
$ pip install streamlit plotly yfinance pandas scikit-learn
```

##### Factors for Better Predictions
<p>A holistic approach combining technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and market sentiment can enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline:</p>

<p><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Gather historical price data, company financials, and relevant news.</p>
<p><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Create relevant features such as moving averages, RSI, P/E ratios, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Model Selection</strong>: Choose appropriate models (e.g., Linear Regression, ARIMA, or machine learning models).</p>
<p><strong>Training and Testing</strong>: Train the model on historical data and validate its performance on a test set.</p>
<p><strong>Prediction and Analysis</strong>: Use the model to predict future prices and analyze the results in the context of broader market conditions.</p>
